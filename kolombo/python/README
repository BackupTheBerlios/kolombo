Features:
---------
Kolombo 3 is in a very early stage of development.

I'm porting all features that the c++ version have right now, but I'm just in
the beginings. To tell the true, this have some new features, for instance this
have full internalization support, have a first run dialog and code to create
the database.

You can add pigeons to database, list them, list by state, print, change the
sex, chage the state and not much more things.

Teorically this version is multiplatform. I'm running it in linux ppc, if you
run it in any other platform, please let me know <agarfu@gmail.com>

The port is written in python and Qt4, when the kde4 bindigs appear I'll use
them.

TODO:
-----
This list is too big about now, I just want to map 1:1 the functionality of
the c++ version and add some more things:

- Plugin system for differents clocks
- ¿Google maps support?
- ¿GPS support?
- Add your suggestion here

Thx for reading till here. Who knows, may be some hay I improve my english.
